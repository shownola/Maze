# README
* This will be a maze game that will run inside the browser
* User will start with a blue ball that will go through the maze and end when the ball touches the green square.
* User will use the "WASD" keys to maneuver the ball.

* CHALLENGES:
* Generate a maze - implement a recursive algorithm
* How to draw this on the screen? - Matter.js, a 2d physics engine for the web
* Make designated keyboard keys control the ball - can use Matter.js to map key presses to movements of shapes
* Detect when the ball touches the green square - Again, Matter.js has the ability to detect collisions between different shapes and report them as events.
